runix
=====

Ruby tooling for operating on nix code.

## The name

I almost called it ruinix!

It's "ruby" + "nix", "ru" "nix".

It though, won't run nix code üê±


## What can it do?

Not much for now! It parses probably valid nix, and probably doesn't parse most nix code.

## Goals

 * `nixfmt`.
 * Code style and tranformation helpers.
 * nix "smells" helper... (e.g. run shellcheck on phases).
